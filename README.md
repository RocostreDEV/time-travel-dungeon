# Dungeon Escape - Development Notes

## üéÆ Current Implementation

### Core Features
- ‚úÖ 30x30 grid-based game board
- ‚úÖ Basic player movement (WASD/Arrow keys)
- ‚úÖ Difficulty selection (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- ‚úÖ HUD with charges, coins, floor display
- ‚úÖ Procedural maze generation
- ‚úÖ Basic guard placement
- ‚úÖ Collectibles (coins, charges)

## üöÄ TODO List

### High Priority
1. Guard AI Implementation
   - [ ] Add flashlight cone visualization
   - [ ] Implement guard patrol paths
   - [ ] Add guard state machine (patrol, alert, chase)
   - [ ] Collision detection with player

2. Time Travel Mechanics
   - [ ] Add time travel animation
   - [ ] Implement checkpoint system
   - [ ] Add travel pods mechanics
   - [ ] Death/respawn system

3. Level Design
   - [ ] Improve maze generation algorithm
   - [ ] Add The Lab rooms every 5 floors
   - [ ] Implement hidden buttons
   - [ ] Add golden keys and chests

### Medium Priority
1. Audio System
   - [ ] Add sound effects for:
     - [ ] Movement
     - [ ] Collecting items
     - [ ] Guard alerts
     - [ ] Time travel
     - [ ] Background music

2. Visual Improvements
   - [ ] Add pixel art sprites for:
     - [ ] Player character
     - [ ] Guards
     - [ ] Items
     - [ ] Environment
   - [ ] Add animations for:
     - [ ] Walking
     - [ ] Time travel
     - [ ] Guard patrols

3. Game Progression
   - [ ] Implement save system
   - [ ] Add store functionality
   - [ ] Create bonus rooms
   - [ ] Add achievements

### Low Priority
1. Polish
   - [ ] Add screen transitions
   - [ ] Implement particle effects
   - [ ] Add tooltips and tutorials
   - [ ] Improve UI/UX

2. Additional Features
   - [ ] Add boss levels
   - [ ] Create story elements
   - [ ] Add power-ups
   - [ ] Implement secrets and easter eggs

## üêõ Known Issues
- Guard placement needs collision detection with walls
- Maze generation sometimes creates isolated rooms
- Player movement could be smoother
- Need to implement coin/charge collection logic

## üîß Technical Debt
- Add proper TypeScript types for grid cells
- Implement proper state management for game saves
- Optimize render performance for larger levels
- Add proper error boundaries
- Implement proper testing suite

## üìù Development Notes
- Consider using Web Audio API for sound effects
- Look into using Canvas for better performance
- Research pathfinding algorithms for guard AI
- Consider implementing WebGL for lighting effects

## üéØ Next Steps
1. Implement guard AI and flashlight mechanics
2. Add proper collision detection
3. Create time travel animation system
4. Improve maze generation algorithm
5. Add checkpoint system

Remember:
- Keep components small and focused
- Document complex algorithms
- Test edge cases
- Optimize performance regularly
- Keep accessibility in mind for future updates
